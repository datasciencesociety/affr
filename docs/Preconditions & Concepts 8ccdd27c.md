## Where We Are Now

The exercise on itself is the way to familiarize with the technological stack, problems and obstacles which may be met during working on DS projects. There is no goal to make a state of art project. The subject and tasks are obscure and not defined.

## Where Do We Go

We want to build a model for recommendations using user activity. There is some understanding of the steps which needs to be done in order to achieve this.

* Get the list of reviewed food in the data set
* Compile a user activity
* Develop a model which predicts user preferences basing on his activity
* Develop a pipeline which updates the model (the model can stay the same, and it will be just rewritten)
* Incorporate TensorFlow (or another NN framework) to achieve same results

# Concepts

First of all we need to take a look what's happening when user choosing a food.
